# Site uses JavaScript, API-calls and/or techniques to prevent content catching, so...

# This works NOT with ftr.fivefilters.net (FTR|Fulltext-RSS)
# This works NOT with wallabag UI

# This only works with wallabagger browser-plugin with activated
# option 'Retrieve content from the browser' in it's settings
# AND you have to activate local image storage in wallabag!

# for videos, you have to wait for the end, when the still image is shown, then hit the wallabagger
# icon to fetch. You will never get the video but the image then.
